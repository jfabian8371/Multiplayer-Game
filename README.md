This is my multiplayer game I made for Advanced 3d Game: Here is rubrik and what i did to get those elements done 
    Multiplayer Functions: 50%
        Can connect locally via two instances or between two devices such as combination mobile/laptop.
            -Showed two clients connecting to the server and then shooting each other and taking damage.
        Contains gameplay requiring interaction between elements spawned on the server and behavior from the host.
            -The interaction when firing at the other player, or hitting the "Bruh box" as I call it
        Has shared elements such as score counter or player state (position, action, etc) for each player, which retain visibility over the network
            -Player health is shared for each player, and can be seen in the log and the health bar above the players
        2D or 3D or combination thereof is fine.
            -I did 3d for all my objects
    Gameplay: 15%
        Can be co-op or pvp.
            -it is pvp
        Should have some level of challenge/fun.
            -killing the other player is hard and I added some cool 3d objects as scenary and then a awesome box that when shot makes a bruh sound
    Art: 10%
        Free assets are fine, but should move past simplistic shapes.
            -the player prefab is a free asset of a body i downloaded on the internet as well as the MP7 gun prefab I found online
    Sound: 10%
        Free assets are fine again, but should contain at least 6 different sounds appropriate to the game.
            -The 6 sounds are a spawn sound, shooting sound, walking sound, dying sound, damage taken sound, and then a box that makes a bruh sound when hit
        NO Background Music. Use of BGM will actually result in loss of points. We need to hear the gameplay sounds.
    Code Review: 15%
        Project will be uploaded to GitHub.
        Code should be clean enough to understand and well commented.
        Should be able to be downloaded, built and run.
